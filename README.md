# Various M4Live devices 

I have made these over the past few years. Code in them 
is not super clean. Feel like finally hosting these somewhere other than 
my computer in some capacity

10D Synth, 50D synth, and the novelty slicers require flucoma but I 
believe that is the only outside libary needed. 

Some of these I have used in various performances to different degrees and 
some others are prototypes for larger Max patches

Feel free to use whatever you wish in any capacity.
